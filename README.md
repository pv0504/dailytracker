# Daily Tracker

A clean, minimal habit tracker that actually stays out of your way. Built because I got tired of bloated habit apps with features I never use.

**Live:** [dailytracker-self.vercel.app](https://dailytracker-three.vercel.app)

## What it does

Track your daily habits. That's it. No gamification, no streaks pressure, no social features. Just you and the habits you want to build.

I made this after trying a dozen habit trackers and finding them all either too complicated or missing something basic. This one does what I need - lets me check off habits, see my progress over time, and doesn't make me feel guilty if I miss a day.

## Features

- Simple habit creation and tracking
- Visual progress overview (because seeing patterns is weirdly motivating)
- Works offline (your data stays in your browser)
- Clean UI that doesn't feel like homework
- Mobile friendly

## Tech Stack

Built with React + Vite because they're fast and straightforward. Styled with Tailwind CSS. Deployed on Vercel.

## Running locally

Clone it, install dependencies, run it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pv0504/dailytracker.git
cd dailytracker
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` and you're good to go.

## Why I built this

Got frustrated with existing habit trackers. They're either too simple (just checkboxes) or way too complex (badges, levels, social features, premium tiers). I wanted something in between - functional but not overwhelming.

Also wanted something I could deploy once and forget about - no backend, no database, just works.
